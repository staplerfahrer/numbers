What this is *not*
---

This is not a usable application. It is really just a personal experiment with Electron and the Ally API.

What this is
---
I wanted to try a few new things. An Electron app for streaming Ally (TradeKing) stock and account information. Uses Material Design Lite.

- rename config.template.json to config.json, edit it to add your API information from invest.ally.com
- install NodeJS
- open a command prompt, navigate to the /numbers subdirectory where config.json is located
- type: npm install
- type: npm start

What this needs
---
It needs a good framework for views and components. Elm would also be great. Right now I'm just repeatedly dumping HTML into containers in order to refresh.
